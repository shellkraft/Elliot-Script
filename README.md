**The "Elliot Script" is a Python script designed to assist in wordlist generation based on personal information extracted through social engineering and OSINT (Open Source Intelligence). It is inspired by a tool the character Elliot Alderson uses in the television series "Mr. Robot" and allows users to create customized wordlists for brute force attacks.**

# 📖 How it Works
- The script prompts the user to enter the file path containing the list of words and numbers.
- It reads the file, separating the lines into two lists: `words` and `numbers`.
- The passwords are created by combining words and numbers in different formats, such as lowercase, uppercase, capitalized, with underscores, and with the first letter of the word capitalized.
- The passwords are saved to a text file named `passwords.txt`.
- Finally, a success message is displayed, indicating the number of passwords generated and the file where they are saved.
